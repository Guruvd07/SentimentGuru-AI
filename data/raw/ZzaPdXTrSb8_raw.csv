@devonkiss,"In your first exercise.. three variables are not needed. C++ is focused on memory management. I came up with the best solution by first setting a to the sum of a+b, then by setting b to the result of a - b, and finally, setting b to a-b as b is now the difference of the sum of both variables from the beginning which is now a. This results in a swapped set of variables, no additional memory needed and solves the exercise as succinctly as possible.

Now, I am not a C++ pro and that is why I am learning it here! But simple mathematics can and should be used to accomplish coding challenges, where possible. We must think outside of the box as often as possible... I hope everyone found their own way to solve this issue and there is certainly nothing wrong with holding an additional extremely small integer in memory for this example.. but it can be achieved in fewer steps with less memory involved and without an additional variable in the namespace.

Keep up the great tutorials, they are appreciated.",0

@yournotdatguypal,I think what makes me drawn to coding so much is that not everybody wants to take the time to learn it and it makes you seem very bright talking computer language lol,0
@yournotdatguypal,Will this course give me a certification?,0
@revathimohanrevathi3085,"Sir,my brain not braining",0
@madilucey,I have tried hundreds of tutorials for C++ and all of them felt useless and I didn't learn anything but this one feels like an actual programming class. Best tutorial I have seen. Watch the whole thing so you dont miss anything.,0
@JanglesBo-p2e,"Someone may have already pointed this out but on your slides for working with numbers, you make reference to the number 255 being 8 (eight) ones (11111111) in binary notation. On the graphic this shows as six. Of course your statement is correct being but the graphic does not match up. Smallest issue I know, but for people using the slides as reference rather than the audio I thought I would highlight it :) Amazing video by the way, you've helped immensely :)",0

@harryhenderson3636,"Help! I can't find a site anywhere to help me. I made a program that prints permutations of an array. But everything is being printed on one line. I want it to look like this:

a b c 
c a b
b a c ... and so on.
DONE - I want this printed at the end of the list too on a new line.

I also want the size to vary with the array length for N = 4 I want:

A B C D
B A C D
C A B D... Hopefully I made it clear. Any help is GREATLY appreciated!",0

@wandersonpereira9884,"Hi Mosh, that's an amazing course. Thanks for sharing.

Do you have a course of C?",0
@KuukaMukayi-vw5qt,The cheat sheet has failed to download,0
@orebelo,Too bad this tutorial uses CLion even though it says the the focus is on the language instead of the IDE but it's not that simple. CLion is a great tool? Yes... but if you are not paid yet for programming with C++ it costs a lot. Unfortunately JetBrain doesn't have the sensibility to understand the needs of newbies releasing a simple version or a subscription accordantly. I'll look else where for a tutorial with a free tool.  Visual Studio is great one of the best but doent have Mac version.  Mac version it's not Visual studio....,0

@mjsmith570,"Prefacing every practical exercise with ""This is incredibly easy, you should be able to do it in a couple seconds"" before asking a complete beginner to figure it out is kinda wack lol.  It ain't super easy if its the first time you've ever been presented with a problem in C++ or any programming language.",2
@pecoliky,"45:10 i arranged them as:

double
double
double
cout string1
string2
string3

is this incorrect? is it about organizing or does it have an effect?",0
@pecoliky,"38:35 probably will be laughed at by anyone who knows math, but i did it in 2 tries, because i forgot to set the int to double xD monke brain work",2
@gonkie4658,"1hr?  From beginner to programmer in 1hr? Ok, why not? I used to own a book called 'Teach Yourself C++ in 21 Days'.  I remember thinking, ' if only I'd seen this book sooner, I coulda avoided all the crap I went through to get into university.  Needless to say, I confidently dropped out of university 3 weeks later, a fully competent C programmer.  I think I'm more or less remembering that right anyway.  Not that it really matters but I never did manage to find the 'Teach Yourself How to Lie About Teaching Yourself C++ in 21 days', book.",0
@pecoliky,"25:00 what i did is change ''file_size'' to ''counter'' and it started displaying the value from ''counter'' instead xD

and then i saw the third bucket solution lmao",0

@JeppeAchtonNielsen,"Thx for a great video, I went through every bit of it and coded all solutions. I couldn't implement the dice program with syntax shown at 1:20:22 luckily this was a blessing in disguise as I came up with a different way to solve the problem. Ended up using a do while loop and seeding srand with rand each iteration.",1
