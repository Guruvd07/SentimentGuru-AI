@devonkiss,"In your first exercise.. three variables are not needed. C++ is focused on memory management. I came up with the best solution by first setting a to the sum of a+b, then by setting b to the result of a - b, and finally, setting b to a-b as b is now the difference of the sum of both variables from the beginning which is now a. This results in a swapped set of variables, no additional memory needed and solves the exercise as succinctly as possible.

Now, I am not a C++ pro and that is why I am learning it here! But simple mathematics can and should be used to accomplish coding challenges, where possible. We must think outside of the box as often as possible... I hope everyone found their own way to solve this issue and there is certainly nothing wrong with holding an additional extremely small integer in memory for this example.. but it can be achieved in fewer steps with less memory involved and without an additional variable in the namespace.

Keep up the great tutorials, they are appreciated.",0,first exercise three variables needed c focused memory management came best solution first setting sum ab setting b result b finally setting b ab b difference sum variables beginning results swapped set variables additional memory needed solves exercise succinctly possible c pro learning simple mathematics used accomplish coding challenges possible must think outside box often possible hope everyone found way solve issue certainly nothing wrong holding additional extremely small integer memory example achieved fewer steps less memory involved without additional variable namespace keep great tutorials appreciated
